Describe the logo and variants here.

To apply a logo, utilize one of the `logo-*` classes below for an outer wrapper.
Apply the `logo` class to a contained, semantically appropriate element. (A
nested container is required for the intrinsic ratio property to be handled
properly.) Text in the nested element will be hidden. No additional markup
should be contained within the wrapper.

{% capture l1 %}
<div class="logo-primary">
  <h1 class="logo">Project Name Here</h1>
</div>
{% endcapture %}

{% capture l2 %}
<div class="logo-alternate">
  <h1 class="logo">Project Name Here</h1>
</div>
{% endcapture %}

### Primary logo display:
{% include sample.html sample=l1 %}

### Alternate logo display:
{% include sample.html sample=l2 %}

A media query is added to check for device pixel density to
override the background-image and use the `2x` (aka &ldquo;retina&rdquo;)
size when appropriate.

If the `svg` class on the `html` element (placed by feature-detection with
[Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/)) is present, the client browser will use the
vector image instead, automatically. Using the `svg` image results in a sharper
image.

The `svg` override also takes precedence over the `2x` retina image, as `svg`
is best when compatible.
